Predictions:
Both foo and foo.html do not have @app.routes, so we're assuming the local host won't run them. Unless folders named static are ran anyway, which is probably the case. We think foo won't run since it's not a .txt, or it might do something unintended.

Notes:
Foo is downloaded, because there is no file extension.
We tried using folders named things other than static, and they weren't ran, static seems to be a specific name
We originally thought app.py was also a specific name, but we realized that the only reason it ran on / is because of app.route
notes.txt doesn't run in the host.
