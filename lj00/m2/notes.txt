- JSON: JavaScript Standard Object Notation
  - Format
    - Start and end with curly braces {}
    - Separate each key and value with a colon
    - Separate each key:value pair with a comma
    - “Keys” must be surrounded by quotation marks
      -  Also called “fields”
  - Sub-document: a field that contains a document as a value
  - Pros: friendly, readable, familiar
  - Cons: Text-based (parsing strings is very slow), space-consuming, only
    supports a limited number of basic data types (String, Boolean, Number, Array)
  - Can be read by humans and machines
- BSON: Binary JSON
  - Optimized for speed, space, and flexibility
  - Supports other data types besides native JSON data types (String, Boolean,
    Number, Array AND date, raw binary)
  - Can be read by machines only
  - Used by MongoDB
- Exporting data in BSON: mongodump --uri “<Atlas Cluster UrI>”
- Exporting data in JSON:
  - mongoexport --uri “<Atlas Cluster URI>”
                --uricollection=<collection name>
		--out=<filename>.json
- URI string: Uniform Resource Identifier
- srv string: more specific string format that establishes a secure connection
  between your application and MongoDB instance
  - mongodb+srv://user:password@clusterURI.mongodb.net/database
- Import data in BSON dump:
  - mongorestore --uri “<Atlas Cluster URI>”
                 --drop dump
  - loads data from a binary database dump
- Importing data in JSON:
  - mongoimport --uri “<Atlas Cluster URI>”
                --drop=<filename>.json
- Namespace: the concatenation of the database name and collection name
- Looked at the sample_training.zips collection & issued the following queries:
  - {“field” : “example”}
  - {“state”: “NY”}
  - {“state”: “NY”, “city”: “ALBANY”}
- Filter: narrows down specific results, query data
- Default database is called “test”
- “admin” is a default database that does administrative tasks (ie keeping track
  of existing users that have access to the database)
- “local” is another administrative database
- show dbs (shows a list of the databases that are in a cluster)
- use <database> (indicates you are working with the database)
  - Points db object (used later) to correct database
- show collections (shows the collections within the database)
- Use a find command to query a collection:
  - db.<collection name>.find({"state": "NY"})
- it: iterates through a cursor (allows you to view the next “page” of results)
- cursor: a pointer to a result set of a query
- pointer: a direct address of the memory location
- db.<collection name>.find(<query>).count() → returns the number of documents
  that match the given query
- db.<collection name>.find(<query>) → returns documents that match the given
  query
- db.<collection name>.find(<query>).pretty() → returns documents that match the
  given query formatted for ease of reading
- db.<collection name>.find({}) → returns 20 documents from a collection
