A lot of groups used reader and DictReader to read their dictionaries.
Some people did "with open()" which is good.
The answers to get rid of the first and last row were very different, some people had a specific range, others popped those rows, others just had an if statement.
There were some very clean answers, like Team "Ethan and Dean", whose code looked really nice
People either did adding the percentages in a loop (like us), or using the random.choices method. They're technically the same, but the random choices method seems a lot better
Also saw randrange, which we think is similar as random choice.
Some people used the F string method which formats strings.
A lot of groups used the split function to format the file instead of using DictReader.
