K08 -- Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity Beta

The command "python3 -m venv ~/myherozero" creates a virtual environment, which is a new self-contained workspace that has its own packages and setup.
The virtual environment will be created in the directory "myherozero" which stores the files and library for the virtual environment.
The environment needs to be activated with the line "source ~/myherozero/bin/activate". Once you activate the environment, the terminal will change prompt to one of the virtual enviornments, using its version.
The virual environment is useful when you don't want all of your packages to be installed globally, as different projects require different versions of python.
You can manage the packages with pip, which installs, upgrades and removes packages.
