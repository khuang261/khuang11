Data Explorer Feature
Indexes tab: A performance advisor for your database where you can view and edit your indexes for the best performance of your Atlas Cluster
Can see how often an index is used, when it was created, and who created it
Schema Anti-Pattern tab: Gives you advice about your data model once enough queries have been issued against the collection
Aggregation tab: Allows us to build aggregation pipelines in the UI and see how data is transformed from one stage of the pipeline to another 
Can view how the data is transformed by different pipeline stages on the right side of the screen 
Reminder: order matters while building an aggregation pipeline
Option to export the pipeline code as multiple languages (allows you to copy and paste into your application’s code)

Documents tab: provides us with a view of the documents within the collection, gives us the ability to filter data, allows us to choose how we view the data
Aggregation tab: works like the aggregation tab in the Atlas Data Explorer
Scheme tab: takes a sample of 1000 documents and analyzes their schema → gives you an overview of the shape of your documents
Index tab: 
Default index is _id
Can create indexes within the tab (can choose if you want the index to be ascending or descending)
