# K05 -- Random Team Member Selector (Edited to include group suggestions)
# 2020-09-30
# The approach we chose for the team that the member was being selected from is that the user should specifiy which
# team they're looking to receive a member from.


# From Python docs:
# random.choice(seq) returns a random element from the non-empty sequence seq. If seq is empty, raises IndexError.
from random import choice
