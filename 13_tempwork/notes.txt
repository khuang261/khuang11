K13 - Template for Success: Programming an updated Flask app based on occupations.csv
2020-10-17

Reflections after looking at each other's code from the last couple of assignments:
- for K10 (occupy_flask_st), Yi Ling used only one function while Kelly used four
  (or so), and Maddy used two
- also, we all incorporated html into our app.py file for K10
- Kelly used the built in csv function to make a dictionary, while Yi Ling and Maddy
  made a dictionary manually reading in the file
- all of our previous teams coded fixie.html very similarly

“Egoless Programming” excerpt
- Rather than thinking of critiques as personal attacks, it’s more beneficial to
  have a more positive attitude about it, like Bill G. He laughed it off and the
  code ended up being really good.
- Accept constructive criticism and don’t be aggressive when you find errors in
  your code.
- Once it becomes “your own code” and you develop an attachment to it, there are
  errors that only someone who doesn’t know the code as well can find.
- Coding relies super heavily on collaboration, and the program can ultimately
  only be as good as the teamwork.
- You should write code with the mindset that someone else is going to read it.

We were unable to complete part four because we spent about an hour and 15 minutes
on the first three parts.
