Predictions
We predict that the template won't load the webpage very well. There are a bunch of brackets that don't really look like code, but it seems that variables will replace them.

Notations
The file runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template, which makes sense, but we didn't really expect http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to also run. In hindsight it only makes sense that it does, but it's still weird to have one file load more than one webpage.
The html is written well, in what seems to be a for loop of source in model_tmplt.html, along with other pieces of code that the templates might be loading.
