- External CSS file links through <link rel="stylesheet". It styles the heading and paragraphs by the name and div class by a period and the name
- Internal CSS uses <style> within <head>, which allows the HTML and CSS content to be on the same file.
- The formatting within <style> is the same within external file.
- In-line can specify styling for singular elements directly within the name of the divider.
  Ex: <div style="background-color: #767676; color: black; padding: 10px;">

- You can play around with different styling in your CSS too. You can make minor tweaks, which contributes to your website's overall appearance.
- Lots of trial and error to get everything correct
